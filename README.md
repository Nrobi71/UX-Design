# User Experience Design - C856 : TASK 1 and 2


## TASK 1: PROJECT APPROACH AND PROTOTYPE

### INTRODUCTION:

The user experience (UX) design process revolves around multiple rounds or iterative cycles of design creation, testing, and modification. As you progress through this process, your design models will increase in fidelity until you have a mockup or prototype that is ready to be handed off to a software developer. It is important to remember that while managing project timelines, expectations, and deliverables helps you meet business needs, it is your application of UX design tools and principles that will enable you to create an intuitive, accessible design that will please and engage your users.

As you work through the UX design process in this task, you will create a wireframe and prototype that can be added to your professional portfolio. Understanding the UX design process will help you as a software developer to build applications that will delight the user.

Refer to the scenario and the “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents to create a timeline, persona, wireframe, and prototype for the project in the scenario. Your wireframe and prototypes will be evaluated based on your application of UX design principles rather than on their visual merits. This means that your designs do not need to appear professional or finalized, nor do you need to use specialized tools to create them. If you choose to use a template to aid you in creating your design artifacts, you will likely need to modify your template to meet the requirements of this assessment. Refer to the requirements and rubric to ensure your submission will reflect your competency in UX design.


### SCENARIO:

You have been contacted by the local government of the small island of Taniti. Since the island’s economy relies heavily on tourism, the Tanitian government has developed a plan to increase the number of tourists who visit the island and its attractions. As part of this plan, they have hired you to design a tourism website.

The Tanitian government has conducted a survey to gather information about current tourists. Their findings from this survey are shown in the “Survey Results” supporting document. The government has also provided you with the attached “About the Island” document to better inform you about Taniti and its visitors.

Taniti’s current website has an outdated look and feel. The page navigation is unclear. All the tourist information is jumbled together on a single page, and the site lacks booking information and links to each activity or option. The site is also not compatible with mobile devices.

The Tanitian government would like you to spend no more than one month designing a new website that will increase tourism on the island of Taniti and provide a welcoming experience for prospective tourists.


### REQUIREMENTS:

A.  Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project.
 

Note: Your timeline does not need to reflect the exact amount of time you will spend on each activity. You may use any tool to create your timeline, including word processing software, a spreadsheet, project management software, presentation software, or another tool of your choice.
 

Note: The file size limit for your timeline cannot be more than 16 MB. Files larger than 16 MB will not be accepted.
 

B.  Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents.
 

C.  Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website.
 

Note: You can use any tool to create the wireframe, such as graphic creation/manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.
 

D.  Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers and then do the following:

1.  Summarize the qualitative feedback you received, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable and relevant to your design.

2.  Explain how you will incorporate the feedback you received to improve your design.
 

E.  Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing. Your prototype must be submitted as a URL link.
 

Note: You can use any tool to create your prototype, such as webpage creation software, GUI editors, or other web development API (e.g., InVision).
 

F.  List five objective usability tasks you want users to test in Task 2 for your prototype.
 

G.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized and for images or graphics from another resource.
 

H.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.



## TASK 2: USABILITY TESTING

### INTRODUCTION:

Usability testing is a critically important step in the user experience design process. In order to create a quality experience that meets the needs of your users, you will need to collect data and feedback from those users at multiple points in the design process. You will then need to consider this feedback and make any necessary modifications to improve your design.



For this task, you will submit your prototype from Task 1 for usability testing via the “Prototype and Peer Review Dashboard” in the web links section and clicking on the “Usability Prototype Submission Form” in the dashboard. You will then be prompted to submit recorded feedback on your fellow students’ designs through the Panopto platform. You will need to confirm the permissions for each of your videos are set to “Your Organization (unlisted), anyone at your organization who has the link can view” and submit your video files on the platform.



After you have provided user feedback for three separate prototypes, you will be able to view the video feedback from other students on your own design. You will use this feedback from your users to inform the remainder of your submission. You will also need to complete and submit the “C856 Task 2 Template” for evaluation as outlined in the Requirements section below.



By conducting usability tests and evaluating the results, you will develop a deeper understanding of the users you are designing for and may even uncover user needs and wants that you were previously unaware of. Incorporating your findings into each subsequent iteration of your design allows you to create a product that satisfies your users.



### SCENARIO:

Great news! Tanitian government officials have reviewed the latest version of your prototype, and they are very excited about your progress. They want you to submit your prototype for usability testing, and they have asked you to provide user feedback for three other designs they are considering.


### REQUIREMENTS:

A.  Using the “Prototype and Peer Review Dashboard” web link, fill out the “Usability Prototype Submission Form”, including your prototype link and the list of five objective usability tasks you provided in Task 1. Complete the “Your Prototype” section in the attached “C856 Task 2 Template” using this information.
 

B.  Choose three of your peers’ prototypes from the “Prototype and Peer Review Dashboard” web link. List each peer’s name in the “Your Completed Peer Reviews” section of the attached “C856 Task 2 Template.””
 

C.  Record yourself and your screen as you give verbal feedback as a user for the three other submissions from part B. Your feedback must address each of the five usability tasks listed by each peer. Submit a link to each of your videos using the “Submit Prototype Review - Link” on the dashboard and include these links in the “Your Completed Peer Reviews” section of the “C856 Task 2 Template.”



Note: Use Panopto to record your user testing videos. Your videos should feature you visibly testing the prototypes (i.e., not in voiceover or embedded video) while wearing professional attire. The video should simultaneously capture both you and your user-testing screen. You should provide a verbal narration and qualitative feedback, as well as your reactions as you perform each usability task.
 

Note: For instructions on how to access and use Panopto, use the "Panopto How-To Videos" and “Panopto FAQs” web links provided below. To access Panopto's website, navigate to the web link titled "Panopto Access," and then choose to log in using the “WGU” option. When preparing to record, select the recording folder "User Experience Design C856 | D479 (student creators) [assignments]." 
 

Note: If you record to your "My Folder," you must apply viewing permissions for your peers to be able to view your videos. Open the video and then open Settings, select Share, and apply "Your Organization (unlisted), anyone at your organization who has the link can view."
 

Note: If you have any problems accessing Panopto or the HJP2 recording folder, please contact Assessment Services at assessmentservices@wgu.edu. It may take up to two business days to receive your WGU Panopto recording permission once you have enrolled in the course.
 

Note: The file size limit for your entire submission cannot exceed 200 MB. Each individual file should not exceed 16 MB.
 

D.  Summarize the feedback from the three reactions you received on your design, including the feedback you received on each of the usability tasks you submitted for testing, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable.
 

Note: List each peer reviewer’s name and Panopto review link in the “Peer Reviews of Your Prototype” section of the attached “C856 Task 2 Template.”
 

E.  Summarize how your design changed throughout the entire UX design process, from the wireframe you created and guerrilla tested in Task 1 to using the feedback from the usability testing in Task 2.
 

F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized and for images or graphics from another resource.
 

Note: You are only required to cite sources from outside this assessment. You are not required to cite reactions from other users. 
 

G.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
